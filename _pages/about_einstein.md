Years ago on a boring afternoon in Yunnan, I learned that every soul will flow. For the first time, I asked: What makes us so dynamic at the first place, and at the end why we become limited? I wondered if we could decompose the complex genetic regulatory network underlying the development and function of our nervous system as a delicate control system, and decipher the intricate genetic and environmental factors rooting behind the neurological disorders that plagued my grandfather and millions of others year after year. Since then, I have been deeply fascinated by the idea to build a systematic landscape of the nervous system that bridges the fast-scaling data from micro to macro neural architectures, and understand interactions within and between genetic and neural networks in the course of behaviour. I'm not any closer to an answer yet, but check back about my safari!!
