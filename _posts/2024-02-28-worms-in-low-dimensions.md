## Worms in Low Dimensions: Eigenworms & qunatitative analysis in C.elegans ethology.

Back in 2008, "qunatitative behavioural analysis" is new to C. elegans community.

Foundation of Eigenworm study: 
1. Pierce-Shimomura 1999: Pirouette turning behaviour is characterized in chemotaxis by Lockery Lab.
